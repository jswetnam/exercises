This repository contains working code solutions to many
programming exercises sourced from a number of textbooks and webpages.

Most exercises are in python, but I spice it up a bit with C and Javascript to
keep things interesting.

Subdirectories are per-source:

- ctci/
  - Cracking The Coding Interview, 5th Edition. By Gale Laackman McDowell.
- lib/
  - Classic CS algorithm building blocks.
- interviews/
  - Telephone and in-person coding exercises.

It's mainly for my reference in practicing for technical interviews,
but the solutions may be of some use to those looking to check their own work.
